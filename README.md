- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the email is not formatted correctly: should show "Oops! That doesnâ€™t look like an email address"

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework


### What I learned

With this project, I continued to grow more comfortable using Tailwind, especially while implementing a responsive design with three different versions. I also enjoyed implementing the custom email validation message using JavaScript. I used the Tailwind forms plugin for the first time on this project and found that it made the form styling quite a bit more streamlined.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Forms plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) - This plugin is really useful when styling forms with Tailwind and activates styling for state changes such as `focus` and `valid`/`invalid`.
